# Docker Playground

This repository has been created to provide a ready-to-roll Docker playground during demos and workshops.

### Disclaimer
Please note that the virtual machines we're going to use are extremly insecure and not meant for production use!
Throughout the workshop we're going to harden the Docker hosts but we will not focus on the security of the underlaying operating system.

Refer to the [Exercises](Exercises) for step-by-step guidance.
